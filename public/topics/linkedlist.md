# Linked List

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

## Concepts

### Nodes and Pointers
- A **Node** stores two things:
  - The actual **value/data**.
  - A **pointer** (`next`) to the next node.

### Traversal
- Visiting all nodes **one by one**, usually to display or search.

### Insertion
- Adding a new node either at the **head** (beginning) or **tail** (end).

### Deletion
- Removing a node based on value or position.

---

## Real-World Analogy

Think of a **linked list** like a **treasure hunt** 🏴‍☠️:
- Each clue (node) has a message (data) and a hint to the next clue (pointer).
- To reach the treasure (last node), you must follow every clue sequentially — no skipping ahead.

## Node Structure

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```

---

## Linked List Structure

```python
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

---

## Basic Operations

### 1. Traversal

Move from the head node through each connected node.

```python
def traverse(self):
    current = self.head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> ")
        current = current.next
    print("None")
```
**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`

---

### 2. Insertion at Head

Insert a new node at the **beginning**.

```python
def insert_at_head(self, value):
    new_node = Node(value)
    new_node.next = self.head
    self.head = new_node
```
**Time Complexity:** `O(1)`

---

### 3. Insertion at Tail

Insert a new node at the **end**.

```python
def insert_at_tail(self, value):
    new_node = Node(value)
    if not self.head:
        self.head = new_node
        return
    current = self.head
    while current.next:
        current = current.next
    current.next = new_node
```
**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`

---

### 4. Deletion by Value

Remove the first node matching a given value.

```python
def delete_by_value(self, value):
    if not self.head:
        return

    if self.head.value == value:
        self.head = self.head.next
        return

    current = self.head
    while current.next and current.next.value != value:
        current = current.next

    if current.next:
        current.next = current.next.next
```
**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`

## Full Linked List Class (Python)

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def traverse(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.value, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

    def insert_at_head(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node

    def insert_at_tail(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = new_node

    def delete_by_value(self, value):
        if not self.head:
            return

        if self.head.value == value:
            self.head = self.head.next
            return

        current = self.head
        while current.next and current.next.value != value:
            current = current.next

        if current.next:
            current.next = current.next.next

# Example usage
ll = LinkedList()
ll.insert_at_head(3)
ll.insert_at_head(2)
ll.insert_at_head(1)
ll.traverse()  # 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None
ll.insert_at_tail(4)
ll.traverse()  # 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None
ll.delete_by_value(2)
ll.traverse()  # 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> None
```

## Time Complexities (Summary)

| Operation              | Time Complexity |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Traversal               | O(n)            |
| Insertion at Head       | O(1)            |
| Insertion at Tail       | O(n)            |
| Deletion by Value       | O(n)            |

## Advantages of Linked Lists

✅ **Dynamic Size:** No need to declare size in advance like arrays.  
✅ **Efficient Insertions/Deletions:** Especially at the beginning.  
✅ **No Memory Waste:** Memory is allocated only when needed.

---

## Disadvantages of Linked Lists

❌ **No Direct Access:** You can’t access elements by index like arrays (must traverse).  
❌ **Extra Memory:** Every node requires additional memory for storing the pointer (`next`).  
❌ **Slower Traversal:** Compared to arrays because of pointer following.

---

# Quick Visualization 📈

```
[1] -> [2] -> [3] -> [4] -> None
```

Each block contains a value and a pointer to the next block!

---

# Conclusion

- Linked lists are great for **dynamic** data where frequent **insertions/deletions** happen.
- Use arrays when you need **fast access** by index.
- **Mastering Linked Lists** is critical before learning advanced data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
