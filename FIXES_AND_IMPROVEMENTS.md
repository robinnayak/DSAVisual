# DSA Visualization Project - Fixes & Improvements

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **LinkedListStep Component Logic**
- **Problem**: Component was showing on all topic pages regardless of relevance
- **Fix**: Only shows LinkedListStep for linked list related topics (linkedlist, doublylinkedlist, circularlinkedlist)
- **Improvement**: Better conditional rendering logic

### 2. **Navigation Issues**
- **Problem**: Topics link in navbar led to broken page
- **Fix**: Created proper `/topic` page with same functionality as homepage but better layout
- **Improvement**: Added dedicated topics page with enhanced design

### 3. **Search Performance & UX**
- **Problem**: No debouncing, immediate filtering on every keystroke
- **Fix**: Added 300ms debounce to search functionality
- **Improvement**: Added search icon, clear button, and visual feedback

### 4. **Input Validation**
- **Problem**: LinkedList animation accepted invalid inputs
- **Fix**: Added proper number validation and boundary checks
- **Improvement**: User-friendly error messages and input constraints

### 5. **Error Handling**
- **Problem**: No error boundaries or graceful error handling
- **Fix**: Added ErrorBoundary component and improved error states
- **Improvement**: Better user experience when things go wrong

### 6. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- **Problem**: Poor mobile layout and responsive design
- **Fix**: Improved grid layouts and mobile-first approach
- **Improvement**: Better touch targets and responsive typography
